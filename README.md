# react-obj-explorer

> Welcome aspiring Tokar! This your first test to enter the front-end team.

> Disclaimer: we don't use React internally, in favor of Vue.
  However, both being quite similar, we're confident that the mastering of one
  leads to a quick mastering of the other ;)

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080

```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

## Instructions

Your aim is to create a very simple visualizer and editor for nested objects,

2. Allow edition of property values
3. Allow edition of property keys
