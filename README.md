## Instructions

Create a fork of this repository to push your code to.

Your aim is to create a very simple visualizer and editor for nested objects,
like the one we put in the `data.obj` of the main instance (check in `src/App.vue`).
Your code should be generic, so that if we change the input object, it still works.

Your missions:
1. Visualize the object clearly
2. Allow edition of values (bonus: avoid mutating the props directly!)
3. Allow edition of keys

Timing: 1h
